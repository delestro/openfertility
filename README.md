# OpenFertility

OpenFertility is an open-source project focused on advancing fertility analysis and prediction using machine learning and data analysis. The goal is to build a __community-driven__ initiative for developing open source tools and models to enhance understanding and decision-making in reproductive medicine.

The idea for this project started after reading the paper [_An annotated human blastocyst dataset to benchmark deep learning architectures for in vitro fertilization_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02182-3) and initial models will be built on the open data they published.

The long-term goal is to achieve
- Tools for training, evaluating, and applying fertility models.
- AI models tailored for fertility analysis.
- Data preprocessing methods for diverse fertility datasets.
- Simple user interfaces to access the models.
- Collaborative opportunities for researchers and developers to contribute.
